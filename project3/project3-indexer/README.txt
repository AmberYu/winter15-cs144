This example contains a simple utility class to simplify opening database
connections in Java applications, such as the one you will write to build
your Lucene index. 

We create index for item name, category, description and union of these three fields.

To build and run the sample code, use the "run" ant target inside
the directory with build.xml by typing "ant run".
